The course is designed to enable students to understand and be conversant with the basic language of retirement and
estate planning, and to understand the pertinent provisions of the US Internal Revenue Code related to these topics. The
course focuses on training an individual’s ability to use this information for making both short-term and long-term planning
decisions. The course progresses at a rapid pace and requires students to prepare regularly for each class session instead
of waiting until the exams. Topics include retirement planning tools, techniques and plans, estate and gift tax calculation and
compliance, estate planning tools and techniques (both pre and post death), probate and non-testamentary disposition of
assets, the use and purpose of trusts, family gifting strategies, estate liquidity, business succession planning, Social Security,

on applied research done in practice, often in conjunction with the preparation or review of financial statements or tax
returns. Applied accounting research typically involves qualitative skills, but the course also introduces academic accounting
research. Students will acquire an understanding of different research skills in applying those skills to conduct research
projects in accounting, auditing, and taxation. The course emphasizes communication and problem-solving while also
extending the students’ technical accounting knowledge and ability to apply accounting rules and regulations.

                        Biomedical Digital Signal Processing is an introductory course into the fascinating world of Digital Signal Processing as it
applies to the clinic. Since modern medical systems employ DSP concepts to analyze biomedical signals, such as the ECG,
there is a need for Biomedical Engineers to gain a more in-depth understanding of the subject. This class is designed to
break the complex subject down into three fundamental areas, hardware systems, mathematical concepts, and software
algorithms. Essential Signal Processing concepts are introduced and then reinforced with multiple biomedical examples and
MatLab simulations, all serving to clarify the subject. Topics include: The Hardware building blocks, Signals and Systems,
Euler’s Equation, Nyquist’s Sampling Theorem as Applied to Biomedical Applications, Convolution, Filters, Adaptive Filters,
the Power Spectrum, and Discrete Fourier Transformations

                        The objectives of this course is to provide an engineering approach to human physiology for engineering students that have
a limited background in Biology as a prerequisite for pursuing a graduate course of study in Biomedical Engineering. Part I
will cover homeostasis and the two master controllers of the body, the nervous system and the endocrine system and their
complementary mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis from a systems engineering point of view. Functional anatomy and
physiology will be covered as well as quantitative methods for the analysis of cell signaling.

                        A study of the physiological functions of major organ systems (Neural, Blood, Muscle, Heart, Vascular System Renal,
                        Respiratory and Lymphatics) and how they interact to maintain homeostasis from a systems engineering point of view.
                        Functional anatomy and physiology will be covered as well as quantitative methods for the analysis of organ function and
                        their interactions. An analysis of changes in the major physiological variables with exercise will be used as an example of the
                        integration of the major organs to compensate for stress.

                        This course traverses through the elemental study of two-dimensional art and design--structural elements, organizational
principles, psychological effects, and communicative functions--focusing on both the technical and the imaginative. Problemsolving studio assignments and critiques combined with visits to museums and galleries enable students to develop criteria
for the analysis and evaluation of images created both by themselves and by others.

and an object or ideas, improve accessibility, and shape our experience of the world. In this class, students will learn
the fundamentals of graphic design with a focus on process and tools. Our goal will be developing visual language that
communicates ideas while being aesthetically satisfying. By the end of the semester students will know how to use layout,
typography, and images to tell stories and communicate ideas.
