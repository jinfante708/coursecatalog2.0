                      This course introduces students to the process of design and seeks to engage their enthusiasm for engineering from the very beginning of the program. The engineering method is used in the design and manufacture of a product. Product dissection is exploited to evaluate how others have solved design problems. Development is started of competencies in professional practice topics, primarily: effective group participation, project management, cost estimation, communication skills and ethics. Engineering Design I is linked to and taught concurrently with the Engineering Graphics course.

                        An introduction to the use of an advanced programming language for use in engineering applications, using C++ as the basic programming language and Microsoft Visual C++ as the program development environment. Topics covered include basic syntax (data types and structures, input/output instructions, arithmetic instructions, loop constructs, functions, subroutines, etc.) needed to solve basic engineering problems as well as an introduction to advanced topics (use of files, principles of objects and classes, libraries, etc.). Algorithmic thinking for development of computational programs and control programs from mathematical and other representations of the problems will be developed. Basic concepts of computer architectures impacting the understanding of a high-level programming language will be covered

Tailored to the Stevens student, styles of writing and communications include technical writing, business proposals and reports, scientific reports, expository writing, promotional documents and advertising, PowerPoint presentations, and team presentations. The course covers the strategies for formulating effective arguments and conveying them to a wider audience. Special attention is given to the skills necessary for professional document structure, successful presentation techniques and grammatical/style considerations.

                      In this course students learn to practice a disciplined engineering process for developing software. Individual skills and practices, such as effort estimation and unit testing, are mastered so that students can become successful members of software engineering teams. Best practices in software engineering are followed, including the use of simple design patterns with well-known properties. Students work in small teams to construct a simple web service using the industry standard Ruby programming language, Rails framework and MySQL database technology.

Data Structures and Algorithms are also covered at an introductory level. Programming Assignments are completed in Java to reinforce the concepts taught during lectures, and labs are conducted weekly to allow for in class practice.

                  The primary goal of this course is to help students develop an ability to make sound economic decisions, thereby facilitating effective evaluation and selection of alternative technical, design, and engineering solutions. In this course students will be exposed to the analysis of financial data, the concept of interest rates, the time value of money, economic analysis using the three worths, internal rate of return and benefit cost analysis. Furthermore, the student will gain a comprehensive knowledge about advanced engineering economy topics such as depreciation, capital cost and recovery, after tax analysis, inflation, sensitivity analysis, risk analysis and simulation. Laboratory exercises include the use of spreadsheets to solve engineering economy problems and a series of labs that parallel the lecture portion of the course.

                  Students learn Software Design best practices. A large focus is placed on user centered design and the software develpment lifecyle (SDLC). Later in the course, students are introduced to a number of critical design patterns, and programming exercises are assigned to practice designing by these principles and enforce proper coding practices.

                    Requirements Acquisition is one of the least understood and hardest phases in the development of software products, especially because requirements are often unclear in the minds of many or most stakeholders. This course deals with the identification of stakeholders, the elicitation and verification of requirements from them, and translation into detailed requirements for a new or to-be-extended software product. It deals further with the analysis and modeling of requirements, the first steps in the direction of software design. The quality assurance aspects of the software requirements phase of the software development process is studied. Also an introduction to several formal methods for requirements specification is presented.

                  In software problem areas that require exploratory development efforts, those with complex requirements and high levels of change, agile software development practices are highly effective when deployed in a collaborative, people-centered organizational culture. This course examines agile methods, including Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Lean, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method and Feature-Driven Development to understand how rapid realization of software occurs most effectively. The ability of agile development teams to rapidly develop high quality, customer-valued software is examined and contrasted with teams following more traditional methodologies that emphasize planning and documentation. Students will learn agile development principles and techniques covering the entire software development process from problem conception through development, testing and deployment, and will be able to effectively participate in and manage agile software developments as a result of their successfully completing this course. Case studies and software development projects are used throughout. Cross-listed with CS 555.

                  The growing complexity of today’s engineered systems presents daunting challenges to those who are charged with creating, operating, enhancing and sustaining them throughout their lifecycles. While the components of these systems require no less design effort than in the past, attention to the components is not sufficient to ensure overall system success. This course focuses on the interactions between the elements of a complex system, the context within which they are designed and operate, and the relationships between the technical systems and the organizations that design them and the enterprises that they serve. Students develop the understanding of techniques and processes that can help them ensure that their individual contributions are not only excellent in themselves, but that they become part of a cohesive, successful whole. This course may not be applied toward a Master’s of Engineering in Systems Engineering or Engineering Management.
